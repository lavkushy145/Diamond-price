# Diamond Price Prediction Project

## 1. Situation:
- The dataset consists of information about various diamonds, aiming to predict the price of each diamond through regression analysis.
- It includes 10 independent variables: carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z), along with a unique identifier (id).
- The target variable is the price of the diamond.

## 3. Task:
- As a data scientist, the role was to develop a predictive model accurately estimating diamond prices based on their characteristics.
- Tasks involved exploring and understanding the dataset, handling missing or inconsistent data, and preprocessing features for model training.
- Regression analysis using machine learning algorithms was implemented for predicting diamond prices.

## 5. Action:
- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
  - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into variable distribution and relationships.
  - Appropriately handled missing data and outliers to ensure dataset quality.
  - Encoded categorical variables like cut, color, and clarity for model compatibility.
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Derived relevant features from dimensions (x, y, z), e.g., calculating volume or density.
  - Utilized domain knowledge to enhance the dataset with additional features influencing diamond prices.
- **Model Development:**
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluating model performance.
  - Applied regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting) for model training.
  - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model accuracy and generalization.
- **Evaluation and Validation:**
  - Assessed model performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared.
  - Validated the model on the testing set to ensure generalization to unseen data.

## 6. Result:
- Developed a predictive model accurately estimating diamond prices based on given features.
- Quantified the model's performance, indicating its predictive capabilities and reliability.
- The model can be deployed for real-world applications, providing a valuable tool for estimating diamond prices in various scenarios.

This project required not only technical skills in data preprocessing and machine learning but also a deep understanding of the diamond industry to effectively enhance the dataset and create a robust predictive model for diamond pricing.
