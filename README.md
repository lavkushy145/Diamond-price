STAR Method for (Diamond Price Prediction Project)

1.	 Situation:
•	The dataset consists of information about various diamonds, to predict the price of each diamond through regression analysis.
•	The dataset includes 10 independent variables, such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z), as well as a unique identifier (id).
•	The target variable is the price of the diamond.

3.	Task:
•	As a data scientist, my role was to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates the price of diamonds based on their characteristics.
•	I needed to explore and understand the dataset, handle any missing or inconsistent data, and preprocess features for model training.
•	Implement regression analysis using machine learning algorithms to predict diamond prices.

5.	Action:
•	Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
o	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the distribution and relationships of variables.
o	Handled missing data and outliers appropriately to ensure the quality of the dataset.
o	Encoded categorical variables like cut, color, and clarity for model compatibility.
•	Feature Engineering:
o	Derived relevant features from the given dimensions (x, y, z), such as calculating the volume or density of the diamonds.
o	Utilized domain knowledge to enhance the dataset with additional features that might influence diamond prices.
•	Model Development:
o	Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
o	Applied regression algorithms such as linear regression, random forest, or gradient boosting to train the model.
o	Tuned hyperparameters to optimize model accuracy and generalization.
•	Evaluation and Validation:
o	Assessed model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics like mean squared error or R-squared.
o	Validated the model on the testing set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen data.


6.	Result:
•	Achieved a predictive model that accurately estimates diamond prices based on the given features.
•	Quantified the model's performance, indicating its predictive capabilities and reliability.
•	The predictive model can be deployed for real-world applications, providing a valuable tool for estimating diamond prices in various scenarios.

This project not only involved technical skills in data preprocessing and machine learning but also required a deep understanding of the diamond industry to enhance the dataset effectively and create a robust predictive model for diamond pricing.

Option 1: Installation from GitHub
Follow these steps to install and set up the project directly from the GitHub repository:

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Run the following command:
conda create -p <Environment_Name> python==<python version> -y
Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional)

Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
conda activate <Environment_Name>/
Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory:
cd [project_directory]
Run the following command to install project dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Project

Start the project by running the appropriate command.
python application.py
Access the Project

Open a web browser or the appropriate client to access the project.
